Getting used to Intel's terminology and platform security elements is a very hard task, especially
for researchers that worked in the higher-levels of the computing stack.

In here, we try to share some notes on the learning process of some of our team members.  Those are
created by the team members themselves in their process of learning, and might not be fully accurate
but instead, represent a step towards the final understanding.
